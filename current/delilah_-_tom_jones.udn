Delilah – Tom Jones

[verse 1]
(Em)I saw the light on the night
that I passed by her (B7)window
(Em)I saw the flickering shadows of love on her (B7)blind

(E)She (E7)was my (Am)woman
(Em)As she deceived me I (B7)watched
and went out of my (Em)mind (D7)

| [chorus]
| (G) My my my (D7)Delilah
| (D7)Why why why (G)Delilah?
| (G)I could (G7)see
| that (C)girl was no good for (A7) me
| (Em)But I was lost like a (B7)slave
| that no man could (Em)free (B7)

[instrumental verse]

[verse 2]
(Em)At break of day when that man drove away
I was (B7)waiting
(Em)I crossed the street to her house
and she opened the (B7) door

(E)She (E7) stood there (Am) laughing
Then (Em)I saw the knife in my (B7)hand
and she laughed no (Em)more (D7)

| [chorus 2]
| (G)My my my (D7)Delilah
| Why why why (G)Delilah?
| (G)So (G7)before
| they (C)come to break down the (A7)door
| (Em)Forgive me Delilah
| I (B7)just couldn’t take any (Em)more

(Em) Forgive me Delilah
I (B7)just couldn’t take any (Em)more
(A) (Em) (B7*)(Em*)
