I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor

[intro] (Am) {tremelo}

[verse 1]
At (Am)first I was afraid, I was (Dm)petrified,
Kept thinkin' (G)I could never live without you (C)by my side.
But then I (Am)spent so many nights thinkin'
(Dm)How you did me wrong,
And I grew (E)strong and I learned (E7)how to get along.

And so you’re (Am)back, from outer (Dm)space
I just walked (G)in to find you here 
with that sad (C)look upon your face
I should have (Am)changed that stupid lock,
I should have (Dm)made you leave your key
If I had (E)known for just second
you’d be (E7)back to bother me.

Go on now(Am) go, walk out the (Dm)door,
Just turn (G)around now, 
cause you’re not (C)welcome anymore
(Am)Weren’t you the one who tried to 
(Dm)hurt me with goodbyes?
Did you think I’d (E)crumble? 
Did you think I’d (E7)lay down and die?

Oh no not (Am)I, I will sur(Dm)vive
For as (G)long as I know how to love 
I (C)know I’ll stay alive.
I’ve got (Am)all my life to live
I’ve got (Dm)all my love to give,
And I’ll (E)survive, I will (E7)survive! 
hey! hey!

(Am)(Dm)(G)(C)(Am)(Dm)(E)(E7)

It took (Am)all the strength I had 
not to (Dm)fall apart,
Kept trying (G)hard to mend the pieces of my (C)broken heart.
And I spent (Am)oh so many nights 
just feeling (Dm)sorry for myself
I used to (E)cry, but now I (E7)hold my head up high...

And you see (Am)me, somebody (Dm)new;
I’m not that (G)chained up little person 
still in (C)love with you.
And so you (F)felt like dropping in, 
and just (Dm)expect me to be free
And now I’m (E)savin’ all my lovin’ 
for (E7)someone who’s lovin’ me.

Go on now (Am)go, walk out the (Dm)door,
Just turn (G)around now, 
cause you’re not (C)welcome anymore
(F)Weren’t you the one who tried to 
(Dm)hurt me with goodbyes?
Did you think I’d (E)crumble? 
Did you think I’d (E7)lay down and die?

Oh no not (Am)I, I will sur(Dm)vive
For as (G)long as I know how to love 
I (C)know I’ll stay alive.
I’ve got (F)all my life to live, 
I’ve got (Dm)all my love to give,
And I’ll (E)survive, I will (E7)survive!
hey! hey!
