(A)But I know that (Bm) this time I have
(C#m)said too much been (D)too unkind

(C#m)I tried to (Bm)laugh about it
(C#m) cover it all up with (Bm) lies
(C#m)I try and(Bm) laugh about it
(C#m) hiding the tears in my (Bm) eyes because

(A)I would break down (Bm)at your feet
and (C#m)beg forgiveness (D)plead with you
(A)But I know that (Bm)it's too late
and (C#m)now there's nothing (D)I can do

(C#m)I tried to (Bm)laugh about it
(C#m) cover it all up with (Bm) lies

I (D)thought that you needed me (E)more

[verse 3]
Now (A)I would do most (Bm)anything
To (C#m)get you back to (D) my side
