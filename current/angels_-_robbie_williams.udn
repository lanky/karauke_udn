Angels - Robbie Williams

{* = single strums }

[intro] (F) (F)

[verse 1]
I sit and (F)wait
Does an angel contempl(Bb)ate my fate? (C)
And do they (F)know the places where we go
when we’re grey and (Bb)old (C)
(C) Cos I have been (Gm7)told
That sal(Bb)vation lets their (Dm)wings unfold (Bb)

So when I’m (Eb)lyin’ in my bed
thoughts (Bb)runnin’ through my head
And I (F)feel that love is dead
(Eb*) I’m loving (Bb*) angels ins(F*)tead

| [chorus]
| And through it (C)all she offers me pro(Dm)tection
| A lot of love and aff(Bb)ection 
| whether I’m right or (F)wrong
| And down the water(C)fall
| wherever it may (Dm)take me
| I know that life won’t (Bb)break me
| when I come to call (F)
| &nbsp;
| She won’t for(Gm7*)sake me {arpeggio}
| (Eb*) I’m loving (Bb*) angels ins(F*)tead

[verse 2]
(F) When I’m feeling weak
and my pain walks down a one-(Bb)way street (C)
I look a(F)bove
and I know I’ll always be (Bb)blessed with love (C)

And (Eb)as the feeling grows
she breathes (Bb)flesh to my bones
And (F)when love is dead
(Eb*) I’m loving (Bb*) angels ins(F*)tead

[repeat chorus]

[instrumental] (Cm) (Bb) (F) (F) (Cm) (Gm7) (F) (F) {x2}

And through it (C)all she offers me pro(Dm)tection
A lot of love and aff(Bb)ection
whether I’m right or (F)wrong
And down the water(C)fall 
wherever it may (Dm)take me
I know that life won’t (Bb)break me
when I come to call (F)
She won’t for(Gm7)sake me
(Eb*) I’m loving (Bb*) angels ins(F*)tead
