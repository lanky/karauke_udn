I Wanna Be Like You – Jungle Book
[intro] (Am)

[verse 1]
Now (Am)I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VI(E7)P
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' (Am)me
I wanna be a man, mancub,
And stroll right into (E7)town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin’ a(Am)round!

| [chorus]
| (G7)Oh, (C)oo-bee-doo (oop-de-wee)
| I wanna be like (A7)you (hup-de-hooby-do-bah)
| I wanna (D7) walk like you
| (G7)Talk like you (C)too (weep-be-deeby-de-boo)
| (G7)You'll see it's (C)true (shooby-de-do)
| An ape like (A7)me (scooby-dooby-do-be)
| Can (D7)learn to be (G7)human (C)too

[verse 2]
Now (Am)don't try to kid me mancub
I made a deal with (E7)you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come (Am)true
Give me the secret, mancub
Clue me what to (E7)do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like (Am)you

| [chorus 2]
| (G7)Oh, (C)oo-bee-doo (oop-de-wee)
| I wanna be like (A7)you (hup-de-hooby-do-bah)
| I wanna (D7) walk like you
| (G7)Talk like you (C)too (weep-be-deeby-de-boo)
| (G7)You'll see it's (C)true (shooby-de-do)
| Someone like (A7)me (scooby-dooby-do-be)
| Can (D7)learn to be (G7)like someone like (C)me (take me home, daddy)
| Can (D7)learn to be (G7)like someone like (C)you (one more time)
| Can (D7)learn to be (G7)like someone like (C)me-eee
